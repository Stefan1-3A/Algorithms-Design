# Algorithms-Design
Homework Assignment

Welcome to my GitHub project. This program was created as part of an assignment.

Below this, I will briefly explain how to download this project and use it. 

# How To Use This Program with CodeBlocks
  We will first start with how to run this program using CodeBlocks. If you don't have CodeBlocks on your computer, you can get it from this link:
  - https://www.codeblocks.org/

After that, you will want to click on the green button labeled `Code`.

And after that, you would want to click on the `Download ZIP`.

And with those simple clicks, you will have the source code on your computer. The next thing that you will want to do is extract the files from the ZIP, open CodeBlocks and just open the project.
Then just simply ,,Build and run" your program.

# How To Download the Project with GIT
To clone this project using Git you would want to go to the same green button labeled `Code`.

* Then, just copy the link thats under HTTPS.
* Use `Git Bash Here` in the file directory where you would want your project to be cloned.
* After that, type git clone [link] in the console that appeared after using `Git Bash Here`.

 # Requirements
 To properly use this program you will need to have the `books.txt` text file in your directory. That's where the numbers/data will be stored.
 
 If you want to use another IDE, the process is the same. You download the source code (or clone it) and run the program with the `books.txt` in the file directory.

 If you want to generate data, the data will be stored in the file directory. If you want to change to the generated data, you will need to copy the numbers from the generated `.txt` file and paste them into `books.txt`.

 
<sub><sup>Side note: If you want to use the program directly, theres a compiled .exe file ready in the Releases section. But that file may be unstable and not fully ready for use, so the best recommendation is to run the project in an IDE.</sup></sub>

<sub><sup>* The file also would need to have the books.txt in the same directory.<sub><sup>

<sub><sup>* The data generated will be appear in the same directory.<sub><sup>
